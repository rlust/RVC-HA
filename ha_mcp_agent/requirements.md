# Requirements Document for Home Assistant Agent Application

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an agent application designed to interface with a Home Assistant MCP (Message Control Protocol) server to enable direct control of Home Assistant-managed devices. The application will allow users to monitor, control, and automate smart home devices seamlessly through a secure and efficient communication channel with the Home Assistant ecosystem.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Device Control
- **FR1:** The application shall send commands to the Home Assistant MCP server to control devices (e.g., turn on/off lights, adjust thermostat settings, lock/unlock doors).
- **FR2:** The application shall receive real-time device state updates from the Home Assistant MCP server (e.g., current light status, temperature readings).
- **FR3:** The application shall support multiple device types, including but not limited to lights, switches, thermostats, locks, and sensors, as supported by Home Assistant.

### 2.2 Device Discovery
- **FR4:** The application shall query the Home Assistant MCP server to discover all available devices and their supported capabilities (e.g., dimmable lights, color-changing bulbs).
- **FR5:** The application shall cache discovered devices locally to reduce server load and improve responsiveness.

### 2.3 Automation Support
- **FR6:** The application shall allow users to create, edit, and delete automation rules (e.g., "Turn on the porch light at sunset") by sending appropriate commands to the Home Assistant MCP server.
- **FR7:** The application shall retrieve and display existing automation rules from the Home Assistant MCP server.

### 2.4 User Interface
- **FR8:** The application shall provide a user-friendly interface (e.g., web, mobile, or desktop) to interact with devices and automations.
- **FR9:** The interface shall display real-time device statuses and allow users to issue control commands with minimal latency.
- **FR10:** The application shall support customizable dashboards for organizing devices and automations.

### 2.5 Authentication and Security
- **FR11:** The application shall authenticate with the Home Assistant MCP server using secure credentials (e.g., API tokens or OAuth).
- **FR12:** The application shall support role-based access control to restrict device control based on user permissions.

### 2.6 Event Handling
- **FR13:** The application shall subscribe to events from the Home Assistant MCP server (e.g., motion detected, door opened) and display notifications to the user.
- **FR14:** The application shall allow users to configure event-based triggers for automations.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- **NFR1:** The application shall process and display device state updates within 1 second of receiving data from the Home Assistant MCP server.
- **NFR2:** The application shall handle up to 100 concurrent devices without significant performance degradation.
- **NFR3:** The application shall maintain a stable connection to the Home Assistant MCP server with automatic reconnection in case of network interruptions.

### 3.2 Security
- **NFR4:** All communication between the application and the Home Assistant MCP server shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **NFR5:** The application shall store sensitive data (e.g., API tokens) securely using encryption or platform-specific secure storage (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).
- **NFR6:** The application shall log all access attempts and control actions for auditing purposes.

### 3.3 Scalability
- **NFR7:** The application shall support integration with multiple Home Assistant instances for users managing multiple homes.
- **NFR8:** The application shall be extensible to support additional device types and protocols introduced by Home Assistant.

### 3.4 Usability
- **NFR9:** The user interface shall be intuitive, requiring no more than 5 minutes for a new user to learn basic device control.
- **NFR10:** The application shall provide clear error messages and recovery options for failed commands or connectivity issues.

### 3.5 Compatibility
- **NFR11:** The application shall be compatible with the latest stable version of Home Assistant and its MCP server.
- **NFR12:** The application shall support deployment on multiple platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, web, desktop) as specified in the development scope.

## 4. Technical Requirements
### 4.1 Dependencies
- **TR1:** The application shall integrate with the Home Assistant MCP server via its documented API or WebSocket protocol.
- **TR2:** The application shall use a modern programming language/framework suitable for the target platform (e.g., Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin).
- **TR3:** The application shall use a library for secure WebSocket communication (e.g., websocket-client for Python, Socket.IO for JavaScript).
- **TR4:** The application shall use a local database or caching mechanism (e.g., SQLite, Redis) to store device metadata and user preferences.

### 4.2 Network Requirements
- **TR5:** The application shall support communication over standard internet protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket) with the Home Assistant MCP server.
- **TR6:** The application shall handle network latency and intermittent connectivity gracefully, queuing commands when offline.

### 4.3 Development and Deployment
- **TR7:** The application shall include unit tests covering at least 80% of the codebase to ensure reliability.
- **TR8:** The application shall be deployed using a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and release management.
- **TR9:** The application shall include comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users.

## 5. Constraints
- **C1:** The application must comply with Home Assistant’s API usage policies and rate limits.
- **C2:** The application must adhere to platform-specific guidelines (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) for mobile deployments.
- **C3:** The application must minimize resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory) to ensure compatibility with low-end devices.
- **C4:** The application must support Home Assistant’s minimum supported version at the time of release.

## 6. Assumptions
- **A1:** The Home Assistant MCP server provides a stable and documented API/WebSocket interface for device control and event subscription.
- **A2:** Users have a working Home Assistant instance with devices already configured.
- **A3:** The Home Assistant MCP server is accessible over a local network or via a secure remote connection (e.g., Nabu Casa).
- **A4:** Users have sufficient permissions to access and control devices via the Home Assistant MCP server.

## 7. Out of Scope
- **OS1:** Direct hardware integration with devices (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave) outside of Home Assistant’s ecosystem.
- **OS2:** Advanced machine learning or AI-driven automation beyond what Home Assistant supports.
- **OS3:** Support for legacy Home Assistant versions not compatible with the current MCP server.

## 8. Future Considerations
- **FC1:** Integration with third-party services (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa) for cross-platform compatibility.
- **FC2:** Support for advanced analytics and usage reports for device activity.
- **FC3:** Implementation of offline mode for limited functionality when the Home Assistant MCP server is unavailable.

## 9. Glossary
- **Home Assistant:** An open-source home automation platform for managing smart devices.
- **MCP Server:** The Message Control Protocol server used by Home Assistant for real-time communication and control.
- **Device:** A smart home entity managed by Home Assistant (e.g., light, thermostat, sensor).
- **Automation:** A rule or script that triggers actions based on device states or events.
